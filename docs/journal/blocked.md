# Blockers / Cross-cutting follow-ups

Items requiring a human decision are top-level. Cross-cutting cleanups
that are not blockers but need to be addressed at a planned point are
listed below.

## Cross-cutting follow-ups

### `conf_parse` cargo-fuzz target

AGENTS.md Section 6.4 lists `conf_parse` as a mandatory fuzz target.
Deferred: the fuzz target lands in the same crate
(`crates/fuzz/`) as `proto_redis_parse`, `proto_memcache_parse`,
`dnode_parse`, and `crypto_aes_decrypt`. Those parsers are the
high-risk fuzz targets and arrive in Stages 7 and 8. The fuzz crate
is created at that point with all five targets; until then, Stage
4 has property tests covering parser totality on arbitrary YAML
strings via `proptest`.
